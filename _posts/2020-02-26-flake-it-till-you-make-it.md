What comes to mind when you think of a forecast? I bet you're imagining your weather application on your phone, or old local news weather forecasts that always seemed to be wrong. Now, have you considered where exactly those forecasts we see on the media actually come from? This blog covers the basics of what a forecast is, and how the last decade has seen a transition strictly from weather forecasts to forecasts of other environmental parameters like water quality and quantity. 

Forecasts are generally defined as near-term iterative future predictions with quantified uncertainty. Lets break this definition down into parts. The first part (near-term iterative future predictions) implies that forecasts are not a single event and instead represent multiple predictions occurring over and over again that improve each time new data become available. Hence, top forecast developers prefer when forecasts are off target because that means the tool used to make the forecast will store this deviation in its memory so the next prediction can better predict a similar event in the future. Think about the past for a second. How far into the future did weather forecasts go 20 years ago: 3, 4, 5, days right? Today, we have weather forecasts that go 7 to 10 days into the future. This is because through time the forecasts have iteratively updated over and over again, and thus have improved the confidence of our forecasts further into the future. The second term (quantified uncertainty) is far less discussed but truly the heart of all forecasting. Hypothetically, imagine a forecast is derived from a toolbox with a bunch of tools in it. When the forecast is off target, scientists can go into the toolbox and decipher mathematically what tool in the box was the root cause of the off-target prediction. Scientists then update that tool and put it back in the toolbox before another prediction is made. Quantifying uncertainty is core to forecasting because it dives into the mechanisms of the forecasts, breaks it into parts, calculates what part is the biggist issue, improves it, and makes another forecast.
